          <h2>My Story</h2>
<p>
  I&apos;m a dedicated full-stack software engineer with 888+ hours of intensive bootcamp training, specializing in modern web technologies including React, Python, Flask, and JavaScript. My comprehensive technical foundation spans both frontend and backend development, with hands-on experience building scalable applications, implementing RESTful APIs, and working with databases. As a committed professional and father of five, I bring exceptional time management skills, attention to detail, and the ability to thrive under pressure while maintaining high-quality code standards.
</p>

<p>
  My experience in video editing, photo manipulation, and creating claymation and stop-motion videos has developed my proficiency with various software tools and my understanding of frame-by-frame precision skills that translate beautifully to frontend animation libraries and performance optimization. The meticulous attention to detail required for stop-motion work mirrors the careful consideration needed for writing efficient, bug-free code. These multimedia skills also make me particularly valuable for teams working on content-rich applications or those requiring custom animations and interactive elements.
